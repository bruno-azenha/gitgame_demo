## Learn colors with your child

This is a simple excercise you can play together with your child. Below is a list of colors and for each color there is a photo of an animal. The color of the animal mathes the color from the list.
Go through the list from to to bottom, ask your child what animal does he/she sees and talk about the color of the animal.
